/*
    - Custom Pages -

    If you wish to add custom pages to ITFlow, add them to the xcustom folder in the root directory with the prefix "xcustom_"
        e.g. If your page was called my_page_one, name it "xcustom/xcustom_my_page_one.php"
    Note: If required, you can use the Custom Links module to have the page show on the user sidebar.

    To process POST data via your custom pages, create a file in this directory (post/xcustom) named after your page (e.g. xcustom_my_page_one.php).
    The relevant file will be automatically loaded upon a POST request based on the referer - your form just needs to target the standard root/post.php.
