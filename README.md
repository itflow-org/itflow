<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

<b>A comprehensive, free & open-source documentation, ticket management, and accounting platform.</b>

[![ITFlow][product-screenshot]](https://itflow.org)


### The Problem
- You're a busy MSP with 101 things to do. 
- Information about your clients is unorganised and unstructured: scattered in random tickets or folders - when you do eventually find it, it's out of date. 
- For some issues, you spend longer looking for the relevant documentation than actually working the ticket. 
- On top of the technical day to day, you also have to take care of the financial side of the business - consistent pricing, quotes/invoicing, and accounting. 

### The Solution: ITFlow
- ITFlow consolidates common MSP needs (IT Documentation, ticketing and billing) into one system

### In Beta
* This project is in beta with many ongoing changes. Updates may unintentionally introduce bugs/security issues. Writing functional, secure code is very difficult.
* Whilst we are confident the code is safe, nothing in life is 100% safe or risk-free. Use your best judgement before deciding to store highly confidential information in ITFlow.
* We are hoping to have a stable 1.0 release by early 2024.
